/**
 leetcode 492 Construct the Rectangle

 A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So,
 given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to
 design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the
 following requirements:

 The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the
 given target area.
 The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
 The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
 Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web
 page you designed in sequence.
